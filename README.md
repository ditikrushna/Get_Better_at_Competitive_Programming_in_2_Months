# Get Better at Data Structure in One Month
This contains the curriculum that I will follow to get better at Data-structure  in 1 months.


 ### **ABOUT** 
 
Since getting better at Data Structures takes a lot of effort, we need to keep practicing a lot of problems. This list will keep youfocussed and you will have a target with you that you need to finish atleast these many problems before moving on. It can help you
organize your practice.

 ####  Day 1 and 2: :clock1:
